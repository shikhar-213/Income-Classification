# Income-Classification
## Project Background: -
A company named ‘Subsidy Inc.’ delivers subsidies to individuals based on their income. Accurate income data is one of the hardest pieces of data to obtain across the world. Subsidy Inc. has obtained a large data set of authenticated data on individual income, demographic parameters, and a few financial parameters. 
This project simplifies the data system by reducing the number of variables to be studied, without sacrificing too much of accuracy. Such a system would help Subsidy Inc. in planning subsidy outlay, monitoring and preventing misuse.
Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
•	Relationships between variables: - Understanding proportion of categorical variables and how several variables are affecting the output variable with the help of frequency tables and visualizations.
•	Insignificant variables: - Finding and removing insignificant variables to reduce model’s complexity.
Visualizations and other key metrics can be found here.

## Data Structure: -
We were given the dataset in csv format named income.csv. This dataset holds 31,978 entries with 12 features and one output variable (i.e. the personal income of individuals).
This dataset is represented as 31978 x 13 in matrix form.
